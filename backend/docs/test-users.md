## Frontend Integration

For frontend development, you can use these credentials to test different user roles:

### Student Dashboard Testing
- Use any student roll number (21A91A0501 to 21A91A0505)
- Password: PR123$
- Should see student-specific features

### Club Management Testing
- Use club names: SAIL, VAAN, LIFE, or KRYPT
- Password: PR123$
- Should see club head management features

### Admin Testing
- Use "PR COUNCIL" as club name
- Password: PR123$
- Should see all administrative features

## Resetting Test Data

To reset the test data, run:
```bash
cd kmit-pr-app/backend
node scripts/seedUsers.js
```

This will:
1. Clear all existing users and clubs
2. Create fresh test data with the same credentials
3. Link club heads to their respective clubs

## Security Notes

- **Initial Password**: All users start with "PR123$"
- **Password Change**: Users can change their password using the `/api/auth/change-password` endpoint
- **Token Expiry**: JWT tokens expire after 45 days
- **Case Insensitive**: Roll numbers and club names are case-insensitive during login

## API Testing

You can test all authentication endpoints with these credentials:

1. **Login** - Use the credentials above
2. **Change Password** - Use the returned JWT token
3. **Verify Token** - Test token validation
4. **Protected Endpoints** - Test role-based access

All backend APIs (events, clubs, messages, hall of fame) can be tested with these user accounts.
